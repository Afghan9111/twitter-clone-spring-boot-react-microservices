### 2. Download the Application

Look for the most recent release. Click on the appropriate file to download the application. You will find files like:

- `twitter-clone-spring-boot-react-microservices.jar` for the backend.
- `client.zip` for the React frontend.

### 3. Install Java and MySQL

Ensure that you have Java JDK 11 or higher installed. If not, download it from the [official Java website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

Also, install MySQL and create a database named `twitter_clone`. You can follow the instructions on the [MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/installing.html).

### 4. Prepare the Configuration

Set up the MySQL database and provide the needed configuration in the application's `application.properties` file. For instance, configure your MySQL connection as follows:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/twitter_clone
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
```

Replace `your_username` and `your_password` with your actual database credentials.

### 5. Run the Backend

Open a terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the `twitter-clone-spring-boot-react-microservices.jar` file and run the following command:

```bash
java -jar twitter-clone-spring-boot-react-microservices.jar
```

This will start the backend server on your local machine.

### 6. Setup and Run the Frontend

Unzip the `client.zip` file in a folder of your choice. Open a terminal within that folder and run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This command will start the React application in your browser.
